  <h1>Privacy Policy for Spatial Gravity</h1>
  <p id="date">Last updated: October 19, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Spatial Gravity is an augmented reality (AR) experience designed for Android XR headsets.
    The app allows users to view virtual planets in their physical space using camera input.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Spatial Gravity does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal data from users.
    The app only uses the device camera and spatial sensors to enable AR functionality — specifically to display virtual planets in real-world environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Camera Access</h2>
  <p>
    The camera is used exclusively for rendering virtual objects.
    Camera data is processed locally on your device and is <strong>never transmitted</strong> or stored on external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Spatial Gravity does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data exposure.
    All processing occurs locally on the user’s XR device.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Spatial Gravity is not specifically directed toward children, but it can be used by all audiences.
    No personal data from children or any users is collected.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a new "Last updated" date.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this policy or the app, you can contact the developer at:
    <a href="mailto:filipvabrousek1@gmail.com">filipvabrousek1@gmail.com</a>
